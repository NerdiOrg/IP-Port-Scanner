# Using the program

In option 1, you will scan common ports of provided IP (argument: <ip>)

In option 2, you will scan all ports (inclusive) 100-999 (arguments: <ip> <min> <max>)

I recommend changing the exact filename to just "portscanner" without the -distribution tag. 

## Linux
```
./portscanner-linux 192.168.1.1
./portscanner-linux 192.168.1.1 100 999
```

## Windows
```
./portscanner-windows 192.168.1.1
./portscanner-windows 192.168.1.1 100 999
```

If that does not work, use exact path:
```
./portscanner-windows.exe 192.168.1.1
./portscanner-windows.exe 192.168.1.1 100 999
```


# Terms of Service
You may only use this for IP addresses you are authorized to connect to in this manner, dependent on local laws, regulations, and the terms of service agreements for port scanning usage.
